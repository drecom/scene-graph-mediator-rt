# scene-graph-mediator-rt

This module converts both scene graph schema and runtime object each other.
Each of converters should know runtime object schema so this module provides _pixi.js_ importer/exporter by default.

The schema definition of scene graph is based on (@drecom/scene-graph-schema)[https://github.com/drecom/scene-graph-schema] .
